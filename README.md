# Retail Customer Insights and Trial Evaluation (Quantium x Forage)


## Project Background


A leading supermarket client sought insights into consumer purchasing behaviour within the snack foods category, with a particular focus on potato chips. The objective was to deliver data-driven recommendations to inform an upcoming category review. The analysis was conducted aiming to enhance their understanding of customer purchasing behaviour and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted in-store trials. 


This involved two primary components:
1. **Customer Insights and Segmentation:**
Analysis of transaction and customer data to identify key drivers of chip sales, uncover purchasing trends, and segment customers by value and behaviour. Data preparation included cleaning, merging, and deriving key variables to support actionable insights.
2. **Evaluation of In-Store Trials:**
Selection of control stores and assessment of performance across three trial stores. This phase focused on measuring the impact of strategic in-store initiatives against defined KPIs, using matched controls and pre/post comparisons to determine effectiveness.


The findings from both phases were consolidated into a recommendation for the category team, with a focus on targeting high-value customer segments, optimising product formats, and assessing the commercial viability of scaling the trial initiatives.
